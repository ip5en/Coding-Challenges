# Challenges folder

Place each solved problem in its own directory:

Structure:
- challenges/
  - 2025-12-11-two-sum/
    - README.md            # problem metadata and statement
    - python/
      - solution.py        # solution implementation
    - tests/
      - test_solution.py   # optional tests

Naming convention:
- Use date + short slug to avoid collisions and provide ordering: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug`.

Example: see `challenges/2025-12-11-two-sum/` for a concrete example.
