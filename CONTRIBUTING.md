# Contributing

Thanks for sharing solutions! Keep things simple:

- Create a new folder under `challenges/` with the name: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>` (e.g. `2025-12-11-two-sum`).
- Add a `README.md` in that folder containing:
  - title
  - source link (e.g. LeetCode / HackerRank URL)
  - difficulty and tags
  - a short description or the problem statement
- Put each solution in a language subfolder, e.g. `python/solution.py` or `javascript/solution.js`.
- Include tests under `tests/` if possible (pytest for Python).
- Keep solutions reasonably commented and include time/space complexity in a comment header.
- Add a short commit message: `Add <slug> solution in <language>`.
