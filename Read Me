# Coding Challenges — Solutions by ip5en

A simple, lightweight layout for storing solved programming challenges.

How this repo is organized
- `challenges/` — each challenge has its own folder (see below)
- `challenges/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/README.md` — problem statement + metadata
- `challenges/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/<language>/solution.<ext>` — solution file (one or more)
- `challenges/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/tests/` — optional tests for CI / local verification

Quick start
1. Create a folder under `challenges/` named `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>` (e.g. `2025-12-11-two-sum`).
2. Add `README.md` with title, source link, short description and metadata.
3. Add solution files in language subfolders (e.g., `python/solution.py`).
4. Optionally add tests in `tests/` so others (and CI) can verify correctness.
